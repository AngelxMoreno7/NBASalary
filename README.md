2. What is the source?
3. What are the response and potential predictor variables?
4. What is the dimension (number of rows and columns)?
5. In this section, also present and discuss relevant summary statistics and graphical displays of your data set (e.g., scatterplots, box plots).
6. Be selective about the descriptive statistics that you decide to include.

Methods and Results
1. Describe the methods used to estimate and select your regression model
2. Present the major modeling results (e.g., regression summary table, diagnostics plots, cross-validation results)
3. Provide a concise description of the results and your interpretation.
